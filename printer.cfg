# This file contains common pin mappings for the Velleman K8200 and
# 3Drag 3D printers (circa 2013). To use this config, the firmware
# should be compiled for the AVR atmega2560.

# Based on config from Martin Malmqvist and Per Hjort.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.

#   The amount of raw filament to push into the extruder during

#   during deceleration. It is measured in millimeters per
#   millimeter/second. The default is 0, which disables pressure
#   advance.
pressure_advance_smooth_time: 0.040
#   A time range (in seconds) to use when calculating the average
#   extruder velocity for pressure advance. A larger value results in
#   smoother extruder movements. This parameter may not exceed 200ms.
#   This setting only applies if pressure_advance is non-zero. The
#   default is 0.040 (40 milliseconds).
